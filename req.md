Okay now can you make this overall a really smooth interactions app like instagram dms or whatsapp. where the chat interface and use real chat apps liek mute icons like the bell thing. chating on thisb app should feel like chating on a real app like whatsapp and instagram dms, very sommth interctions. optimise this overall for a mobile functionlity. 

Also, can you change the color scheme to a more warm color accents, that feels a bit dreamy. so the chat app will be used by people who are also imaganing the futrue based on teh text interactions, and the scenes for teh fuure are set for slightly warmer colors. but remeber to make this liek a realfile chat app color scheme itself

Finally guide me step by step on how i can deploy this application on vercel tell me if ineed to use some other thing also. 


The app should be an PWA that the characters will add as an app on their phone

Also, use a purplish blue colr scheme. 
In the chat screen remove the image and video sen options only include a camera options that should work. The user should be able to click a image form their camera and send the image. LAos remove teh voicenote thing from teh chat screen. 
Include the profile details page whoch shows the persons profile photo, user can select the photo and view and zoom, etc . It shold have a status, etc similar to how whatsapp profile details page looks. 

Also the chat functionality should be real time. meaning if teh directot chosses the Akash profile and starts typing the divyanshi chat screen should show three dots. and when the first user send the message should appear on the other users chat screen realtime. also it should turn to double tick for seen. if the other person has not seen the messgae it should not be blue tick. 

Increase the font size a bit. make the images a bit larger, consider the whatsapp screenshot that i ahve attached. 

optimse the chat screen for a mobile exprience. meaning if the user clicks on the chat bubble. it should support the mobile keyboard that comes up and the chat section shold be aligned with eh keyboard just like it is on whatsapp. make this expeiece really smooth. The send button shoudl be sloghtly larger like whatsapp. 
Include a chat background liek whatsapp which has many svgs for eg. 

Make this liek a PWA that can be added on teh phone. optimse the whole interface for mobile fiendly and very close to a realy chat pp like whatspp with smotth animatiosn and interacteions. The chat bubble itself should follow whatsapp like design










Requirements for the chat film app that we need to build

I'm working on a short file described below,

The narrative explores a developing online connection between Divyangini, a Mumbai-based creative, and Akash, a Bengaluru-based tech worker, contrasting their differing backgrounds and life perspectives. The excerpts also introduce Tiya, who becomes Akash's partner in the imagined future. The story seems to oscillate between present-day online interactions and a future scenario where Divyangini visits Akash and Tiya, suggesting themes of friendship evolution, imagined possibilities, and the influence of technology on relationships. Ultimately, the film appears to contemplate the complexities of connection, personal growth, and how imagined futures shape our present choices.

One of the major part of this film is a chat app, where the two protagonist Akash and Divyangini text each other.

I want you to write the specs for this chat app that I can feed into an LLM to design and built this app. and the use this app in the movie making process. For example the director will text as A. while on camera D. will read those texts and react. 

I'm shring some high level requiments for the app. You can consider this and add more to it. 
the first screen will be to select the role, Akash or Divyangini, the actor will select one of the role to go to teh chat screen, meanwhile the director will select the othe role and reply back to the chats from behind the camera
1. The chat app is like instagram dm for example,  like how after meeting on an app like bumble, two people move to personal apps like instagram dm.
2. set in the present day, so you can be as creative as you want or make it look cool. The users are in the very late 20s. I am thinking dark mode with some warm accents is what they will most likely use right? (The color scheme in the film is warm for the future scenes, cool for the present scenes - but for the apps (present) - I think the warm accents can signify a connection to the imagination in the future? and maybe stand out from the cool surroundings?). 
3. the chat app screen could be personalized for the actors too, they both can have different backgrounds for the chat depending on their personality
4. Their chat will also contain lots of 'reels' - these can just be images like how a reel looks on Instagram dm with a play icon - I want to show a lot of conversations today are hinged on non-personal 'media'. It's okay if the reels do nnot play, but images with a play button should work
5. There will be a seen feature, this can be minimilistic like a double tick, si that it does not clutter the UI, maybe follow how instagram dm handles see
6. "typing" feature with the dots, that shows up when the other person is typing the message
7. "mute" feature where the user will mute the chat as in the climax scene. 
8.  There is also a scene where a pic is being sent which A. opens, hence the chat interface sgould also allow sending pics and also the ability to view the pic in fullscreen when opend and zoom into teh pic should also be supported


Process:
1. Give the requirement to o1, deepseek, gemeni 2.5 pro and ask it to turn this ionto a detailed tech specs for the app in cluding diffrent screens like selecting the time present / future, selecting the characters A. or D. and then a chat interface, seen comment, design the chat experice more like instagram DMs, there should be an option to mute chat, ability to send an image, there should be an ability to add a reel messge i.e nothing but an image with a play button. 
2. take the achitecture and specs docuemnt and feed it to v0 for the UI bit
3. get to cursor iterate for a bit, add some features
4. Write scripts to do common tasks, like add reels, past messages, etc
5. deploy on vercel 

Questions that I have:
1. Do A and D. know each other from before? Did the future really happen or is this just how D. imagines the future based on the text cinversations that she's ahiving with A. ? 
2. I think the mention of not having kids is too sudden, and is that the reason the drift apart seems too simple for me? or maybe i don't know much cases




























Requirements for the chat film app that we need to build

I'm working on a short file described below, I'm also attaching the script for the film for reference.

The narrative explores a developing online connection between Divyangini, a Mumbai-based creative, and Akash, a Bengaluru-based tech worker, contrasting their differing backgrounds and life perspectives. The excerpts also introduce Tiya, who becomes Akash's partner in the imagined future.

One of the major part of this film is a chat app, where the two protagonist Akash and Divyangini text each other.

I want you to built this chat app so that this app can be used on set when shooting teh actual film. For example the director will text as A. while on camera D. will read those texts and react. Remember your main goal is to understand the scene from the script and how the chat app is being used in the film, and ultimately build this app to be used on the film set.

I'm shring some high level requiments for the app. You can consider this and add more to it. 
the first screen will be to select the role, Akash or Divyangini, the actor will select one of the role to go to teh chat screen, meanwhile the director will select the othe role and reply back to the chats from behind the camera
