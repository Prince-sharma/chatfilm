Can you make the below changes:

1. Reduce the font size overall by 2px 
2. On mobile phone, the keyboard is not aligned with the text box of the chjat screens properly. when I type a message and send the message is sent but the textbox goes down, it's not aligned to keyboard anymore and takes time to adjust. I want this to be similar to how top chat apps behave where the keyboard is always there, and the user can type a message send and the continue typing the next message without any issues, the keyboard stays up and when the user presses the back button it goes away. please fix this.
3. When the user click on the mute above. The button turns red. 
So when it happens... The rest of the screen, suppose it had 100% brightness before, after clicking the mute button turns to something like 70% brightness later, please fix this so that it does not happen and the screen should not fade after muting the conversation

Fix the below issue:
1. The send button becomes purple when we click on it twice (As Akash) can you make it such that it remains blue only?, this happens on mobile on laptop the send button becomes purple when the user hovers over it
2. Also the white value of D's name isn't the same as Akash's so please make them the same as Akash as well, the name for divyangi looks pale
3. remove Divyangini's photo and keep the default one as before, with her name initials as DI 

There's stil some issues, please fix them :
1. the send message button only lights up when the user clicks on it it is faded otherwise, please fix this such that it is always bright 
2. Divyangini's name and profile picture still looks faded as compared to akash, please fix this such that both have similar brightness overall


Done the below changes:
1. In mobile, the keyboard should persist after sending a messge like insa dms or whatsapp
2. Improved the animations for typing and sending a message the slight jerky issue should not happen now
3. Removed the gap on the right for chat messges bubbles 
4. Removed the online indicator form the profile
5. removed the time from the message bubbkle sent
6. Added the functionality to long press and delete

The long press to delete the functionality still doesn't work properly. When any of the charcater long presses to delete the chat messge the message should disappear from both of the chat screens simultenaously in real time. and refrsing the page should also remove the deleted messages. and the deleted messges should go away since they were deleted. curremntly on reloading it brings back the deleted messages. please fix this


1. The long press to delete functinality is not working as extected, when I delet the messge from one character chat screen ot should also be removed from teh other character chat screen and not be visble to eother of them in the chat thread
2. When the user sends a loger messge it should just occupy slightly more tha the 50% of the screen wodth just likie how oon whatsapp the longer message looks
3. There's a huge gap between the messages and the blue tick, delivered tick. the tick should be samller and subtle just below the message, hence giveving more space for the text and only a subtle tick indication at the bottom of the message
4. make the typing to sent animation more smooth like how it works on instagram dm


To do:
1. In mobile, When I type a message and then click on the send message button the keyboard goes down on it's own. This should not happen I should be able to send message one after another without the keyboard goin down on a mobile phone. similar to apps like whatsapp and instagram dm
2. When the sent message appears on the chat screen, it's slightly jerky. PLease making this typing and sending message animation more smooth like how it's in instagram dm
3. In the chat screen there's a gap on the right side an the text bubble, can you jinimise this gap? make it look like instagram dm for example (screenshot attached) remember you don't need to copy the exact design from instagram, the text bubbles looks good on shape for now so we don't need to ake round, etc
4. Remove the online indicator form the profile
5. Can you also remove the time from the message bubbkle sent, so that it looks more natural like instagram dms
6. Can you add an functionality where If i long press a sent message the message gets deleted automatically wothout any confirmation as such there can be a simple user friendly delete animition thouugh



















Can you implement the below for me, since i'm hosting both fromtned and backend in same vercel machine I need to not run the backend on a specifc port but rather create a new api route as any standard backend and frontned application will have. analyse the whole codebase and implenent such that both backend and frontend run on the same machine suing best idustry practices and architecture, maybe implement api roiutes. Remember I do not want to implement this in the same next.js I want to have seperate backend and frontend as it is now and run both of them on same vercel server. just add api routes in the backend so that it's accesible

go through the whole codebase, and fix this please 


Okay now can you make this overall a really smooth interactions app like instagram dms or whatsapp. where the chat interface and use real chat apps liek mute icons like the bell thing. chating on thisb app should feel like chating on a real app like whatsapp and instagram dms, very sommth interctions. optimise this overall for a mobile functionlity. 

Also, can you change the color scheme to a more warm color accents, that feels a bit dreamy. so the chat app will be used by people who are also imaganing the futrue based on teh text interactions, and the scenes for teh fuure are set for slightly warmer colors. but remeber to make this liek a realfile chat app color scheme itself

Finally guide me step by step on how i can deploy this application on vercel tell me if ineed to use some other thing also.

The app should be an PWA that the characters will add as an app on their phone

Also, use a purplish blue colr scheme. 
In the chat screen remove the image and video sen options only include a camera options that should work. The user should be able to click a image form their camera and send the image. LAos remove teh voicenote thing from teh chat screen. 
Include the profile details page whoch shows the persons profile photo, user can select the photo and view and zoom, etc . It shold have a status, etc similar to how whatsapp profile details page looks. 

Also the chat functionality should be real time. meaning if teh directot chosses the Akash profile and starts typing the divyanshi chat screen should show three dots. and when the first user send the message should appear on the other users chat screen realtime. also it should turn to double tick for seen. if the other person has not seen the messgae it should not be blue tick. 

Increase the font size a bit. make the images a bit larger, consider the whatsapp screenshot that i ahve attached. 

optimse the chat screen for a mobile exprience. meaning if the user clicks on the chat bubble. it should support the mobile keyboard that comes up and the chat section shold be aligned with eh keyboard just like it is on whatsapp. make this expeiece really smooth. The send button shoudl be sloghtly larger like whatsapp. 
Include a chat background liek whatsapp which has many svgs for eg. 

Make this liek a PWA that can be added on teh phone. optimse the whole interface for mobile fiendly and very close to a realy chat pp like whatspp with smotth animatiosn and interacteions. The chat bubble itself should follow whatsapp like design










Requirements for the chat film app that we need to build

I'm working on a short file described below,

The narrative explores a developing online connection between Divyangini, a Mumbai-based creative, and Akash, a Bengaluru-based tech worker, contrasting their differing backgrounds and life perspectives. The excerpts also introduce Tiya, who becomes Akash's partner in the imagined future. The story seems to oscillate between present-day online interactions and a future scenario where Divyangini visits Akash and Tiya, suggesting themes of friendship evolution, imagined possibilities, and the influence of technology on relationships. Ultimately, the film appears to contemplate the complexities of connection, personal growth, and how imagined futures shape our present choices.

One of the major part of this film is a chat app, where the two protagonist Akash and Divyangini text each other.

I want you to write the specs for this chat app that I can feed into an LLM to design and built this app. and the use this app in the movie making process. For example the director will text as A. while on camera D. will read those texts and react. 

I'm shring some high level requiments for the app. You can consider this and add more to it. 
the first screen will be to select the role, Akash or Divyangini, the actor will select one of the role to go to teh chat screen, meanwhile the director will select the othe role and reply back to the chats from behind the camera
1. The chat app is like instagram dm for example,  like how after meeting on an app like bumble, two people move to personal apps like instagram dm.
2. set in the present day, so you can be as creative as you want or make it look cool. The users are in the very late 20s. I am thinking dark mode with some warm accents is what they will most likely use right? (The color scheme in the film is warm for the future scenes, cool for the present scenes - but for the apps (present) - I think the warm accents can signify a connection to the imagination in the future? and maybe stand out from the cool surroundings?). 
3. the chat app screen could be personalized for the actors too, they both can have different backgrounds for the chat depending on their personality
4. Their chat will also contain lots of 'reels' - these can just be images like how a reel looks on Instagram dm with a play icon - I want to show a lot of conversations today are hinged on non-personal 'media'. It's okay if the reels do nnot play, but images with a play button should work
5. There will be a seen feature, this can be minimilistic like a double tick, si that it does not clutter the UI, maybe follow how instagram dm handles see
6. "typing" feature with the dots, that shows up when the other person is typing the message
7. "mute" feature where the user will mute the chat as in the climax scene. 
8.  There is also a scene where a pic is being sent which A. opens, hence the chat interface sgould also allow sending pics and also the ability to view the pic in fullscreen when opend and zoom into teh pic should also be supported


Process:
1. Give the requirement to o1, deepseek, gemeni 2.5 pro and ask it to turn this ionto a detailed tech specs for the app in cluding diffrent screens like selecting the time present / future, selecting the characters A. or D. and then a chat interface, seen comment, design the chat experice more like instagram DMs, there should be an option to mute chat, ability to send an image, there should be an ability to add a reel messge i.e nothing but an image with a play button. 
2. take the achitecture and specs docuemnt and feed it to v0 for the UI bit
3. get to cursor iterate for a bit, add some features
4. Write scripts to do common tasks, like add reels, past messages, etc
5. deploy on vercel 

Questions that I have:
1. Do A and D. know each other from before? Did the future really happen or is this just how D. imagines the future based on the text cinversations that she's ahiving with A. ? 
2. I think the mention of not having kids is too sudden, and is that the reason the drift apart seems too simple for me? or maybe i don't know much cases




























Requirements for the chat film app that we need to build

I'm working on a short file described below, I'm also attaching the script for the film for reference.

The excerpts also introduce Tiya, who becomes Akash's partner in the imagined future.

One of the major part of this film is a chat app, where the two protagonist Akash and Divyangini text each other.

I want you to built this chat app so that this app can be used on set when shooting teh actual film. For example the director will text as A. while on camera D. will read those texts and react. Remember your main goal is to understand the scene from the script and how the chat app is being used in the film, and ultimately build this app to be used on the film set.

I'm shring some high level requiments for the app. You can consider this and add more to it.

# Deploying Chat Film App on Vercel

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your Film Set Chat PWA application.

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account (you can sign up with your GitHub account)
- A [Render](https://render.com/) account or another hosting service for your Socket.IO server

## Step 1: Prepare Your Application for Deployment

1. **Update Socket.IO server URL**

   Before deploying, you need to modify how your app connects to the Socket.IO server. Open `hooks/use-real-time-chat.ts` and update the `SOCKET_SERVER_URL`:

   ```typescript
   const SOCKET_SERVER_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL || "http://localhost:3001";
   ```

2. **Create a production-ready Socket.IO server**

   Create a new file called `server.js` in the root directory for the production Socket.IO server:

   ```javascript
   const { Server } = require("socket.io");
   const { createServer } = require("http");
   const express = require("express");
   const cors = require("cors");

   const app = express();
   app.use(cors());
   
   // Basic health check route
   app.get("/", (req, res) => {
     res.send("Socket.IO server is running");
   });

   const httpServer = createServer(app);
   const io = new Server(httpServer, {
     cors: {
       // In production, restrict origins to your Vercel deployment URL
       origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN || "*",
       methods: ["GET", "POST"]
     }
   });

   // Copy the rest of your socket-server.js content here
   
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
   httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Socket.IO server listening on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

3. **Add required dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install express cors dotenv --save
   ```

4. **Create a .env.local file (don't commit this to git)**

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-socket-io-server-url.com
   ```

5. **Update .gitignore file**

   ```
   .env.local
   .env
   ```

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. Initialize Git repository if not already done:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub

3. Push your code to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/chatfilm.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 3: Deploy the Socket.IO Server on Render

1. Log in to [Render](https://render.com/)

2. Click on "New" and select "Web Service"

3. Connect your GitHub repository

4. Configure your web service:
   - Name: `chatfilm-socket-server`
   - Environment: `Node`
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `node server.js`
   - Select an appropriate instance type (Free tier is fine for testing)

5. Add environment variables:
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`: Set this to your Vercel app URL (e.g., `https://chatfilm.vercel.app`)

6. Click "Create Web Service"

7. Wait for the deployment to complete and note down the URL (e.g., `https://chatfilm-socket-server.onrender.com`)

## Step 4: Deploy the Next.js App on Vercel

1. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

2. Click "New Project"

3. Import your GitHub repository

4. Configure your project:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: ./
   - Build Command: Leave as default
   - Output Directory: Leave as default

5. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL`: Set this to your Render Socket.IO server URL

6. Click "Deploy"

7. Wait for the deployment to complete

## Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Domains"

2. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions

## Step 6: Test Your Deployed Application

1. Open your deployed app in two different browsers or devices

2. Select different roles in each browser (Akash and Divyangini)

3. Verify that chat messages are being sent and received in real-time

4. Test all features: typing indicators, read receipts, image sharing, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Socket.IO Connection Issues

If you're experiencing connection issues between the Next.js app and the Socket.IO server:

1. Check that your CORS settings on the Socket.IO server allow requests from your Vercel domain

2. Verify that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` environment variable is correctly set in Vercel

3. Check the browser console for any connection errors

### Render Free Tier Limitations

If using Render's free tier, note that your service will sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. This means the first connection might take a few seconds as the server wakes up.

### Continuous Deployment

Both Vercel and Render support automatic deployments when you push to your GitHub repository. This makes it easy to update your application:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Vercel and Render will automatically rebuild and deploy your changes

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

To ensure your PWA is working correctly after deployment:

1. Visit your deployed site on a mobile device
2. Add it to your home screen
3. Verify that it launches in standalone mode
4. Test offline functionality if implemented

## Conclusion

Your Film Set Chat PWA is now deployed and accessible to users. The Next.js frontend is hosted on Vercel, and the Socket.IO server is hosted on Render, allowing real-time communication between users.

Remember to monitor your application's performance and scale your resources as needed based on user traffic.
