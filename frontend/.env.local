# For local development
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001

# For Vercel deployment, set NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL as an environment variable in the Vercel project settings. 
# Set its value to your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., https://your-app-name.vercel.app) or simply "/" if using Vercel's routing.
# Using "/" is generally recommended as Vercel will route /socket.io requests to your backend function automatically based on vercel.json.
